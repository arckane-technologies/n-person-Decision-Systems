\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\paragraph{} The n-person Decision Systems theory has the logical tools to become a framework for designing decision systems that we can proof have properties that we desire. This combined with new distributed technology can create powerful computer software that help us take fast and quality decisions made by any amount of persons. For example a political system can become really flexible, dynamic and addoc to the crowd by creating a meta decision system, where the decisions to be made are new decision systems for different sectors or issues of the country, in which influence is localized to these and different sub decision systems can be applied depending on the sector or issue. Hopefully the world can find a faster growing rate thanks to formalizing how we choose action and how fast we adapt to new issues.
