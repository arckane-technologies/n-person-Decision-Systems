\section{Democratic Systems}\label{democratic systems}

\paragraph{} In this section we will exemplify the usage of the n-person decision systems theory by modeling a well known decision system, democracy.

\paragraph{Democratic System} is a decision system where the threshold of each decision is half of the sum of influences of the community.

$$\alpha = \frac{\sum\limits_{m \in M} infl(m)}{2}$$

\paragraph{Representational System} is a decision system where the influence change function does a total or partial transfer of the influence, for example a complete representational system is one where:

$$\pi(x, y) = <0, x+y>$$

\paragraph{Pure Democratic System} is a non-representational democratic system where there is no transfer of influence and the initial value of influence of every member is the same:

$$\alpha = \frac{\sum\limits_{m \in M} infl(m)}{2}$$
$$\phi = a \wedge a > 0$$
$$\pi(x, y) = <x, y>$$

\paragraph{Real Democratic System} is any decision system equivalent to the pure democratic system.
