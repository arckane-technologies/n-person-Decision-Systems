This article exposes the necessity of formalizing \textbf{decision systems}, mechanisms for which some amount of actors can jointly decide over what ever topic. Then such formalization is proposed using the concepts of \textbf{knowledge bases} and \textbf{logical entailment} from artificial intelligence and logic, the formalization gains power by modeling the \textbf{members}, \textbf{ideologies}, \textbf{decisions}, \textbf{voting}, \textbf{influence}, influence \textbf{transfer} and the \textbf{functions} that rule how the systems work. For exemplification a well known decision system is modeled: Democracy. Also a strong relationship of this model with \textbf{Game Theory} is briefly explained.
